# Bootcamp Mini Project / Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description 

This project was created using HTML, CSS, Boostrap v5 and Javascript to make a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The project had the following requirements:

* Code out the rock-paper-scissors game.
* The player will play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.
* The player can enter R(ock), P(aper), or S(cissors) to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
* The computer will choose R(ock), P(aper), or S(cissors) in return.
* There should be the option to play again whether I win or lose.
* We should see total wins, ties, and losses after 10 rounds.
* The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.
